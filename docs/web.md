joist.web
=========

Overview
--------

joist.web is a component-based web framework based heavily on [Click](http://incubator.apache.org/click)'s approach of component-generated HTML. Its most unique feature is using [bindgen](bindgen.html) to handle data binding.

Its strength is enterprise data-entry apps that have hundreds of pages of repeated forms, tables, forms, tables. joist.web can implement these in succinct, type-safe Java definitions and avoid lines and lines of repetitive template code.

Currently joist.web's weakness is doing nifty Ajax stuff. This is on the todo list, but waiting for a good problem to drive its solution.
