Click is meant to be: 1) super-simple and 2) solve the problems the way we want in our webapp. This is not going to change, and we have so many pages, that this approach is essentially frozen for us.

Your application will probably be the same way--you'll want to tweak a few things, then write a lot of pages, and not want the framework to change. So, really, you should never really want to upgrade.
