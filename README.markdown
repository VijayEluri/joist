
Overview
========

Joist is a webapp development stack that consists of:

* joist.domain--an ORM with type-safe queries (no strings) and no runtime class generation (no CGLIB).
* joist.web--a page-, component-based web framework that leverages bindgen for type safe data binding

See [http://joist.ws](http://joist.ws) for more documentation.

Todo
====

* Composite columns (e.g. TimePoint with both time+zone), if needed
* Group by queries
* Execute/load hand-written SQL queries (with inheritance?)
* H2 prototyping (continue spike in h2 branch)
* Setup trac/something
* Eager loading (continue spike in eager branch)
* Ajax/JSON controls
